 <!--The use of boilerplate was very helpful in having an empty template to start however it did not include the link to normalize which I had to manually put
  in. In general I am comfortable editing from an empty boilerplate html template onwards and as this assignment progresses, I'm learning more and more and
  becoming increasingly confident in creating a website-->

      <h2>I am who I am</h2>
      <p>I wanted to get into web development to build a tool that can change the mental health world which would simplifying the search for resources and
        application process for support(s). I'm super excited to see who I meet along the way and discover how we can help eachother. As a licensed mental health
        practitioner, I understand the importance for human connection in teamwork and thus am looking forward to building strong bonds with my teammates.
        Three unique assets I bring to a team are imagination, curiosity, and passion.</p>
      <p>I like to believe I'm a pretty normal person. For you to get the know me better, let me share some information about me in the next 
        two sections below.</p>

    <!--Claudio and I went over the formatting/indenting for the section above, indenting means the indented code is within the previous code. 
    So for example h2 ends on line 30 it does not go onto 31 necessarily so <p> within it is a sibling/same level as h2 on line 30. 
    The li directly belong to ul and ol which is why they are indented. Of course h2 and p, etc fits into main and section so they are indented.
    Also for <p> when I hit enter, i do not need to use tab after I've hit enter to put it into a lower line.-->
